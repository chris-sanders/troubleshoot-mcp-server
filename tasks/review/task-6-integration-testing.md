## Objective
Conduct comprehensive integration testing of the MCP server and create complete documentation for users and developers.

## Context
With all components implemented and the container build process established, we need to conduct thorough integration testing to ensure everything works together correctly. We also need to create comprehensive documentation for both users and developers.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Integration tests that cover:
  - End-to-end workflow from bundle initialization to file exploration
  - Error handling and recovery
  - Container functionality
  - MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation including:
  - User guide with installation and usage instructions
  - Tool documentation with examples
  - Developer guide for extending the server
  - Architecture and design documentation
  - API reference
- [ ] Example prompts and responses for AI models
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup and Basic MCP Server
- Task 2: Implement Bundle Manager
- Task 3: Implement Command Executor
- Task 4: Implement File Explorer
- Task 5: Create Dockerfile and Build Process

## Implementation Plan

1. Write integration tests:
   - Create test_integration.py with end-to-end tests
   - Test workflow from bundle initialization to file exploration
   - Test error handling and recovery
   - Test MCP protocol compliance

2. Create user documentation:
   - Installation instructions
   - Configuration options
   - Tool documentation with examples
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. Create developer documentation:
   - Architecture overview
   - Component descriptions
   - API reference
   - Extension guide

4. Create example prompts and responses:
   - Bundle exploration workflow
   - Diagnosing common issues
   - Analyzing cluster state
   - Investigating application failures

5. Test everything together:
   - Run integration tests
   - Manually test with real support bundles
   - Validate documentation accuracy

## Validation Plan
- Run integration tests with real support bundles
- Verify that the workflow functions correctly
- Check that error handling works as expected
- Validate documentation against actual functionality
- Test example prompts with AI models

## Progress Updates
2025-04-11: Started task, created branch, moved task to started status
2025-04-11: Created integration test suite testing all components together
2025-04-11: Created comprehensive user documentation including:
            - User guide with installation and usage instructions
            - API reference with detailed endpoint descriptions
            - Developer guide for extending the server
            - Example prompts and responses for AI models
            - Troubleshooting guide with common solutions
2025-04-11: Updated README.md with new documentation links and improved structure

## Evidence of Completion
- [x] Created comprehensive integration test suite (mcp-server-troubleshoot/tests/test_integration.py)
- [x] Created user guide with installation and usage instructions (docs/user_guide.md)
- [x] Added API reference documentation (docs/api_reference.md)
- [x] Created developer guide for contributors (docs/developer_guide.md)
- [x] Added example prompts and responses (docs/examples/prompt_examples.md)
- [x] Created troubleshooting guide (docs/troubleshooting.md)
- [x] Updated README.md with new documentation links
- [x] Final code review completed

## Notes
The integration tests should use realistic support bundles to verify functionality. The documentation should be clear, comprehensive, and include both conceptual information and practical examples. The example prompts should cover a range of common use cases to help users get started quickly.
