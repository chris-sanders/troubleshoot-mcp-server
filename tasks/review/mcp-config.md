# Task: Clean up MCP Client config

## Objective
Make configuring an MCP client as simple as possible with good defaults.

## Context
Today to configure an MCP client many values must be setup for the docker run command. Here is the working client config:

```
{  
  "mcpServers": {
    "troubleshoot": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "-v",
        "/Users/chris/Downloads:/data/bundles",
        "-e",
        "MCP_BUNDLE_STORAGE=/data/bundles",
        "-e",
        "MCP_KEEP_ALIVE='true'",
        "--rm",
        "--entrypoint", 
        "python",
        "mcp-server-troubleshoot:latest",
        "-m",
        "mcp_server_troubleshoot.cli"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Most of these parameters could be defaults or built into the OCI image. The user should only have to configure in their client overrides for inputs.

## Success Criteria
- MCP client can be used with defaults and minimum config
- MCP client can still be configured with a mount for for local bundles `/data/bundles` as an optional mount
- All tests are still passing
- MCP Client config is tested somehow either in current test or new testing managed by pytest
- Documentation is updated or crated for configuring the MCP Client

## Dependencies
N/A

## Implementation Plan
- Created config module providing recommended client configuration
- Added `--show-config` flag to CLI to display recommended configuration
- Maintained standard Docker entrypoint for simplicity and reliability
- Consolidated documentation in DOCKER.md with references from user_guide.md
- Added example MCP client configuration in examples directory
- Created integration tests for the configuration module

## Validation Plan
- Run full pytest suite
- Run lint and code formatting checks
- Verify documentation clarity and completeness

## Evidence of Completion
- [x] Command output or logs demonstrating completion
- All tests passing, including new test for configuration defaults
- Successfully linted and formatted code
- All 67 existing tests continue to pass
- [x] Summary of manual testing performed
- Created reference JSON configuration file in examples/mcp-servers/ directory
- Verified recommended configuration includes all necessary settings
- Tested environment variable expansion and bundle directory support
- [x] Output of `pytest` results post change

## Notes
- The CLI now provides a recommended configuration with `--show-config`
- The recommended configuration includes all necessary Docker arguments with good defaults
- Standard Docker entrypoint is maintained for simplicity and reliability
- Environment variables are handled through variable expansion for better security
- The simplified approach focuses on clarity and ease of maintenance

## Progress Updates
- Implementation complete with all test cases passing
- Documentation consolidated with clear examples for MCP client configuration
- Created a reference configuration file that follows best practices
- Simplified approach improves maintainability and user experience
