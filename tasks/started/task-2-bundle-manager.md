## Objective
Implement the Bundle Manager component that can download, extract, and initialize support bundles using sbctl.

## Context
After setting up the basic MCP server structure, we need to implement the Bundle Manager component that will handle support bundles. This component is responsible for downloading bundles from remote sources, initializing them with sbctl, and providing the necessary information for kubectl commands and file operations.

Related documentation:
- [Component: Bundle Manager](/docs/components/bundle-manager.md)
- [System Architecture](/docs/architecture.md)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Bundle Manager implementation that can:
  - Download support bundles from URLs
  - Handle local bundle files
  - Initialize bundles with sbctl
  - Provide bundle metadata
  - Track the current active bundle
- [x] Unit tests for Bundle Manager functionality
- [x] Integration with the MCP server for the "initialize_bundle" tool
- [x] Error handling for various bundle operations
- [x] Documentation updated with implementation details

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup and Basic MCP Server
- sbctl installed in the development environment
- Network access for downloading bundles

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new file src/mcp_server_troubleshoot/bundle.py to implement the Bundle Manager component:
   - Define BundleManager class with necessary methods
   - Implement bundle download functionality
   - Implement sbctl integration
   - Add error handling and logging

2. Update the server.py file to:
   - Register the "initialize_bundle" tool
   - Implement the tool call handler for bundle initialization
   - Define the Pydantic model for bundle initialization arguments

3. Write unit tests for Bundle Manager functionality:
   - Test bundle initialization from local files
   - Test bundle initialization from URLs
   - Test error handling

4. Update documentation to reflect the implementation details

## Validation Plan
- Run pytest to verify unit tests pass
- Manually test bundle initialization with local files
- Manually test bundle initialization with remote URLs
- Verify that sbctl is properly called to initialize bundles
- Verify proper error handling for invalid bundle sources

## Progress Updates
2025-04-11: Started task, created branch, moved task to started status
2025-04-11: Implemented BundleManager class with download and initialization capabilities
2025-04-11: Integrated BundleManager with MCP server and added "initialize_bundle" tool
2025-04-11: Added comprehensive unit tests for BundleManager and updated server tests
2025-04-11: Task implementation completed, ready for review

## Evidence of Completion
- [x] Implementation of BundleManager class with all required functionality
- [x] Integration with MCP server for bundle initialization
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests for all components
- [x] Commit history showing implementation steps

## Notes
The Bundle Manager should be designed to handle both local and remote bundle sources. For remote bundles, it should download the bundle to a specified directory before initialization. For security reasons, the Bundle Manager should validate bundle sources and prevent directory traversal attacks. Authentication for bundle download should be handled via environment variables.
