## Objective
Create the project structure, set up dependencies, and implement a basic MCP server with stdio communication that can respond to tool listing requests.

## Context
This is the first task in building the Troubleshoot MCP Server. We need to establish the foundation for the rest of the project by setting up the directory structure, configuration files, and implementing the basic MCP server with stdio communication.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Project directory structure created following the defined pattern
- [x] pyproject.toml file created with appropriate dependencies
- [x] Basic MCP server implementation that can start up
- [x] Server can respond to tool listing requests (returns empty list for now)
- [x] Unit tests for basic server functionality
- [x] Documentation updated with implementation details

## Dependencies
None (this is the first task)

## Implementation Plan
1. Create project directory structure:
   ```
   mcp-server-troubleshoot/
   ├── .python-version
   ├── README.md
   ├── pyproject.toml
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── test_server.py
   └── src/
       └── mcp_server_troubleshoot/
           ├── __init__.py
           ├── __main__.py
           └── server.py
   ```

2. Set up pyproject.toml with basic dependencies:
   - mcp package for MCP protocol implementation
   - pydantic for data validation
   - pytest for testing

3. Implement basic MCP server in server.py:
   - Create a Server instance
   - Implement stdio communication
   - Register a list_tools handler that returns an empty list
   - Implement basic error handling

4. Implement server initialization in __init__.py and __main__.py:
   - Create main function to parse arguments
   - Set up async event loop
   - Call the serve function

5. Write unit tests for basic server functionality:
   - Test server initialization
   - Test tool listing

6. Create a README.md with basic project information and setup instructions

## Validation Plan
- Run pytest to verify unit tests pass
- Manually test the server with the MCP inspector tool
- Verify that the server starts up without errors
- Verify that the server responds to tool listing requests with an empty list

## Evidence of Completion
- [x] Commit history showing implementation of basic MCP server
- [x] Project structure created according to implementation plan
- [x] Unit tests implemented for server functionality
- [x] README.md with project information and setup instructions

## Notes
This task focuses on establishing the project structure and basic server functionality without implementing any specific tools yet. The subsequent tasks will build on this foundation to add bundle management, kubectl command execution, and file operations.

After review, the implementation was updated to use FastMCP instead of the lower-level Server class, which provides a simpler API and better compatibility with the latest MCP protocol. A dummy tool was added to ensure the server returns at least one tool when queried. All tests were updated to reflect these changes and are now passing. Code has been formatted and linting issues have been fixed to match project standards.
