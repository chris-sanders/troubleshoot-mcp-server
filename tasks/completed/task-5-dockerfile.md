## Objective
Create a Dockerfile and build process for packaging the MCP server as an OCI container using Podman.

## Context
With the core functionality implemented, we need to package the MCP server as an OCI container for easy deployment. This task involves creating a Dockerfile, setting up the build process, and ensuring that the containerized server works correctly.

- [System Architecture](/docs/architecture.md)

## Success Criteria
- [x] Dockerfile that:
  - Uses an appropriate base image
  - Installs required dependencies (sbctl, kubectl)
  - Sets up the Python environment with uv
  - Configures the entrypoint
  - Handles volume mounts for bundle storage
- [x] Build script or instructions for building with Docker (instead of Podman as requested)
- [x] Successful container build and run tests
- [x] Documentation for container usage and configuration
- [x] Support for environment variables for authentication

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup and Basic MCP Server
- Task 2: Implement Bundle Manager
- Task 3: Implement Command Executor
- Task 4: Implement File Explorer
- Podman installed in the development environment

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a Dockerfile at the root of the project:
   - Use appropriate base image (e.g., Python + uv)
   - Install system dependencies (sbctl, kubectl)
   - Copy project files
   - Set up the Python environment
   - Configure the entrypoint
   - Define volume mounts
   - Set up environment variables

2. Create a build script or instructions for building with Podman:
   - Commands for building the container
   - Commands for running the container
   - Environment variable configuration

3. Test the containerized server:
   - Build the container
   - Run basic functionality tests
   - Verify that tools work as expected
   - Check volume mount handling

4. Update documentation with container usage instructions:
   - Building the container
   - Running the container
   - Configuring environment variables
   - Mounting volumes

## Validation Plan
- Build the container with Podman
- Run the container with various configurations
- Test tool functionality within the container
- Verify that volume mounts work correctly
- Verify that environment variables are properly handled

## Progress Updates
2025-04-11: Started task, created branch, moved task to started status
2025-04-11: Created multi-stage Dockerfile with all required dependencies
2025-04-11: Added build.sh and run.sh scripts for container management
2025-04-11: Created .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
2025-04-11: Added DOCKER.md with detailed usage instructions
2025-04-11: Updated main README.md with Docker information
2025-04-11: Task implementation completed, ready for review
2025-04-11: PR reviewed and merged, task complete

## Evidence of Completion
- [x] Multi-stage Dockerfile with proper dependency installation
- [x] Build and run scripts for container management
- [x] Documentation for container usage in DOCKER.md
- [x] README.md updates with Docker installation information

## Notes
The Dockerfile should be designed for security and efficiency, using multi-stage builds if necessary to minimize the final image size. The container should be configurable through environment variables and volume mounts to support different deployment scenarios. The build process should be documented clearly to ensure reproducible builds.
