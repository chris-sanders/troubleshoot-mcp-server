## Objective
Set up the repository structure with proper documentation and task organization based on project kickoff materials.

## Context
Before development can begin, we need to establish the repository structure, documentation, and workflow based on the project kickoff materials. This includes setting up the documentation for architecture and components, creating task files, and implementing the workflow structure.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Repository structure created
- [x] Architecture documentation established
- [x] Component documentation for all major components
- [x] Task files created for planned development
- [x] README.md with project overview
- [x] CLAUDE.md with guidance for agentic tools
- [x] Project kickoff materials archived or removed

## Dependencies
None (initial repository setup)

## Implementation Plan
1. Create directory structure for docs, tasks, etc.
2. Set up documentation in the docs directory:
   - Architecture documentation
   - Component documentation
   - Agentic workflow documentation
3. Create task files in the tasks/ready directory for planned development:
   - Task 1: Project Setup and Basic MCP Server
   - Task 2: Implement Bundle Manager
   - Task 3: Implement Command Executor
   - Task 4: Implement File Explorer
   - Task 5: Create Dockerfile and Build Process
   - Task 6: Integration Testing and Documentation
4. Create README.md with project overview
5. Create CLAUDE.md with guidance for agentic tools
6. Remove project kickoff materials
7. Set up git repository with upstream remote

## Validation Plan
- Verify all directory structure is in place
- Ensure all documentation files are complete and consistent
- Check that all task files are properly formatted and include required metadata
- Confirm README.md provides a comprehensive overview
- Verify CLAUDE.md provides appropriate guidance for agentic tools

## Progress Updates
2025-04-11: Created directory structure and added main documentation files
2025-04-11: Created component documentation for all major components
2025-04-11: Added task files to tasks/ready directory
2025-04-11: Created README.md and CLAUDE.md
2025-04-11: Removed project kickoff materials
2025-04-11: Set up upstream repository and created branch
2025-04-11: Pushed branch to remote repository
2025-04-11: Rebased branch on main and force pushed to resolve history issues
2025-04-11: Created PR #1: https://github.com/chris-sanders/troubleshoot-mcp-server/pull/1
2025-04-11: PR #1 approved and merged
2025-04-11: Task marked as completed

Body:
## Summary
- Set up the repository structure with proper documentation and task organization
- Added architecture documentation and component documentation for all major components
- Created task files for planned development in tasks/ready directory
- Added README.md with project overview and CLAUDE.md with guidance for agentic tools
- Removed project kickoff materials

## Test plan
- Verify all directory structure is in place
- Ensure all documentation files are complete and consistent
- Check that all task files are properly formatted and include required metadata
- Confirm README.md provides a comprehensive overview
- Verify CLAUDE.md provides appropriate guidance for agentic tools

## Evidence of Completion
- [x] Directory structure with docs and tasks
- [x] Complete documentation for architecture and components
- [x] Task files for planned development
- [x] README.md with project overview
- [x] CLAUDE.md with guidance for agentic tools
- [x] Project kickoff materials removed
- [x] Repository configured with upstream remote

## Notes
This task prepares the repository for subsequent development. The task files created will drive the development workflow, and the documentation will provide guidelines for implementation.
