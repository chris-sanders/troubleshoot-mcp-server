## Objective
Implement the File Explorer component that can list, read, and search files within the support bundle.

## Context
After implementing the Bundle Manager and Command Executor, we need to add the File Explorer component to provide access to the files within the support bundle. This will allow AI models to explore log files and other artifacts contained in the bundle without requiring the entire bundle to be loaded into context.

Related documentation:
- [Component: File Explorer](/docs/components/file-explorer.md)
- [System Architecture](/docs/architecture.md)

## Success Criteria
- [x] File Explorer implementation that can:
  - List files and directories within the bundle
  - Read file contents with optional line range filtering
  - Search for patterns across files (grep-like functionality)
  - Ensure file access is contained within the bundle
  - Format operation results consistently
- [x] Unit tests for File Explorer functionality
- [x] Integration with the MCP server for file operation tools
- [x] Documentation updated with implementation details

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup and Basic MCP Server
- Task 2: Implement Bundle Manager

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new file src/mcp_server_troubleshoot/files.py to implement the File Explorer component:
   - Define FileOperations class with necessary methods
   - Implement directory listing functionality
   - Implement file reading with line range filtering
   - Implement pattern search functionality
   - Add security measures to prevent directory traversal
   - Implement error handling and logging

2. Update the server.py file to:
   - Register the file operation tools ("list_files", "read_file", "grep_files")
   - Implement the tool call handlers for file operations
   - Define the Pydantic models for file operation arguments
   - Connect the File Explorer with the Bundle Manager

3. Write unit tests for File Explorer functionality:
   - Test directory listing
   - Test file reading with different line ranges
   - Test pattern searching
   - Test security measures against directory traversal
   - Test error handling for invalid paths

4. Update documentation to reflect the implementation details

## Validation Plan
- Run pytest to verify unit tests pass
- Manually test directory listing with different paths
- Manually test file reading with various line ranges
- Manually test pattern searching with different patterns
- Verify that security measures prevent access outside the bundle
- Verify proper error handling for invalid paths

## Progress Updates
2025-04-11: Started task, created branch, moved task to started status
2025-04-11: Implemented FileExplorer class with directory listing, file reading, and file searching functionality
2025-04-11: Added security measures to prevent directory traversal attacks
2025-04-11: Integrated with MCP server and implemented file operation tools
2025-04-11: Added comprehensive unit tests for all functionality
2025-04-11: Fixed multiple code style and linting issues
2025-04-11: Successfully rebased implementation on top of main branch
2025-04-11: All tests are passing - task implementation completed

## Evidence of Completion
- [x] All unit tests for FileExplorer component are passing
- [x] Integration tests for server file operations are passing
- [x] Code passes all linting and formatting checks
- [x] Security measures properly enforce file access containment
- [x] Implementation successfully rebased onto main branch

## Notes
The File Explorer implementation provides a robust and secure way to explore and access files within Kubernetes support bundles. The implementation:

1. Lists files and directories with metadata
2. Reads file contents with line range filtering
3. Searches for patterns across files using regular expressions
4. Includes security measures against directory traversal
5. Properly integrates with the MCP server
6. Formats operation results consistently for consumption by AI models

All functionality is thoroughly tested and passing all checks.
