# Task: Update Dependencies and Python Version

## Status: Completed

## Description
Update all project dependencies to use the latest versions, remove unnecessary version constraints, and update the project to support Python 3.13. The focus is on:
1. Removing pinned version constraints from `pyproject.toml`
2. Updating Python target versions from 3.9 to 3.13 in build tools
3. Setting minimum Python version to 3.13
4. Fixing any compatibility issues with newer dependency versions
5. Properly configuring asyncio/pytest settings to avoid warnings

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Removed unnecessary version constraints from `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Updated Python targets in `tool.ruff`, `tool.black`, and `tool.mypy` sections to 3.13
- [x] Updated minimum Python version requirement to 3.13
- [x] Added Python 3.13 classifier
- [x] All tests pass with updated dependencies and Python 3.13
- [x] Fixed pytest-asyncio warning about fixture loop scope configuration
- [x] Documented changes in the task file and created comprehensive dependency management guide

## Implementation Notes
The dependencies have been updated by removing unnecessary version constraints, particularly for the MCP package. This makes the dependency specifications more flexible while ensuring all tests still pass with the latest versions.

Python target version was updated from 3.9 to 3.13 to leverage the latest Python features and performance improvements. The following changes were made:

1. Updated `requires-python` to ">=3.13" in pyproject.toml
2. Updated `target-version` in ruff to "py313"
3. Updated `target-version` in black to ["py313"]
4. Updated `python_version` in mypy to "3.13"
5. Added Python 3.13 classifier
6. Fixed pytest-asyncio warnings by properly configuring fixture and test loop scopes
7. Created a comprehensive dependency management guide in docs/dependency_management.md
8. Updated Docker configuration to use Python 3.13
9. Added proper UV integration for dependency management

The implementation also includes improvements to the test suite, addressing asyncio-related warnings and improving test quality with more behavior-focused tests.
