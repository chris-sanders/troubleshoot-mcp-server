## Objective
Implement the Command Executor component that can run kubectl commands against the initialized support bundle's API server and process the results.

## Context
With the Bundle Manager in place, we now need to implement the Command Executor that will allow running kubectl commands against the initialized bundle's API server. This component will use the kubeconfig generated by sbctl to execute commands and format the results for consumption by AI models.

Related documentation:
- [Component: Command Executor](/docs/components/command-executor.md)
- [System Architecture](/docs/architecture.md)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Command Executor implementation that can:
  - Execute arbitrary kubectl commands
  - Configure the environment with the correct kubeconfig
  - Format command outputs in a consistent way
  - Handle command execution errors
  - Process both JSON and text outputs
- [ ] Unit tests for Command Executor functionality
- [ ] Integration with the MCP server for the "kubectl" tool
- [ ] Documentation updated with implementation details

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Project Setup and Basic MCP Server
- Task 2: Implement Bundle Manager
- kubectl installed in the development environment

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a new file src/mcp_server_troubleshoot/kubectl.py to implement the Command Executor component:
   - Define KubectlExecutor class with necessary methods
   - Implement command execution functionality
   - Add output formatting
   - Implement error handling and logging

2. Update the server.py file to:
   - Register the "kubectl" tool
   - Implement the tool call handler for kubectl command execution
   - Define the Pydantic model for kubectl command arguments
   - Connect the Command Executor with the Bundle Manager

3. Write unit tests for Command Executor functionality:
   - Test command execution with various kubectl commands
   - Test error handling for invalid commands
   - Test output formatting for different output types

4. Update documentation to reflect the implementation details

## Validation Plan
- Run pytest to verify unit tests pass
- Manually test kubectl command execution with various commands
- Verify that output formatting is consistent
- Verify proper error handling for invalid commands
- Verify that environment configuration with kubeconfig works correctly

## Progress Updates

## Evidence of Completion
- [ ] Screenshot of successful test execution
- [ ] Code review showing implementation of Command Executor
- [ ] Documentation of Command Executor implementation
- [ ] Commit history showing implementation steps

## Notes
The Command Executor should support arbitrary kubectl commands to provide maximum flexibility. It should also handle different output formats (JSON, YAML, text) and provide appropriate error messages for invalid commands. When executing commands, it should ensure that the environment is properly configured with the kubeconfig from the initialized bundle.
