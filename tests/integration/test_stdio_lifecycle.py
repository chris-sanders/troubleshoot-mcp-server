"""
Integration tests for the stdio lifecycle functionality.

NOTE ON TEST COVERAGE: These tests were originally written to verify stdio lifecycle
functionality directly. However, with the new lifecycle architecture that uses
FastMCP's lifespan context manager, these direct subprocess tests are no longer
compatible with the server's architecture.

The functionality previously tested here is now properly tested in the e2e container
tests which provide a more appropriate environment for testing the full lifecycle:

1. test_container.py: Tests basic functionality of the container
2. test_mcp_protocol.py: Tests MCP protocol communication
3. test_docker.py: Tests Docker container lifecycle including proper cleanup

The tests below are kept for documentation but are skipped with appropriate
skip reasons explaining why they're not suitable for the new architecture.
