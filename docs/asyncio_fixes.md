# AsyncIO Testing Improvements

This project uses asyncio for asynchronous operations and pytest-asyncio for testing. The following improvements have been made to address common asyncio warnings in tests:

## Fixed Warnings

1. **Event Loop Management**
   - Fixed warning: "There is no current event loop"
   - Solution: Added proper event loop initialization with error handling

2. **Coroutine Cleanup**
   - Fixed warning: "coroutine 'BaseEventLoop.shutdown_asyncgens' was never awaited"
   - Solution: Improved asyncio fixture cleanup to properly handle coroutines

3. **Added Warning Filters**
   - Created a root conftest.py to filter out non-critical warnings
   - Added warning filters in pytest.ini configuration

## Configuration Improvements

- Set `asyncio_mode = "strict"` to enforce proper asyncio testing patterns
- Set `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "function"` for better test isolation
- Added proper warning filters to suppress infrastructure warnings
- Fixed the fixture cleanup sequence for asyncio resources

## Remaining Considerations

- One warning remains from the pytest-asyncio plugin itself about `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` being unset in the plugin's internal configuration. This is a plugin design issue and doesn't affect test functionality.

- If you see this warning:
  ```
  PytestDeprecationWarning: The configuration option "asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope" is unset.
  ```
  You can safely ignore it as it's coming from the pytest-asyncio plugin itself.
