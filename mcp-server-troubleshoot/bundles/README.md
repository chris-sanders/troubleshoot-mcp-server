# Bundles Directory

This directory is used by the MCP server to store bundles during runtime.

- When running locally, bundles will be downloaded and extracted here
- When running in the container, this directory is volume-mounted to a host directory

This directory is intentionally empty in the repository but is needed for application functionality.
