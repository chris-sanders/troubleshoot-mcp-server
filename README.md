# Troubleshoot MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI models to interact with Kubernetes support bundles generated by the [Troubleshoot](https://troubleshoot.sh/) tool.

## Overview

The Troubleshoot MCP server allows AI models to:

1. Initialize support bundles from local files or remote URLs
2. Execute kubectl commands against the bundle's emulated Kubernetes API server
3. Explore and search log files within the bundle
4. Analyze cluster state and diagnose issues

This server acts as a bridge between AI models and the data contained in support bundles, allowing efficient exploration without loading the entire bundle into the model's context.

## Features

- **Bundle Management**
  - Initialize bundles from local files or remote URLs
  - Handle authentication for protected bundles
  - Manage bundle lifecycle

- **Kubectl Integration**
  - Execute arbitrary kubectl commands
  - Formatted command output
  - Support for various output formats

- **File Operations**
  - List files and directories
  - Read file contents with line filtering
  - Search for patterns across files (grep-like functionality)

- **MCP Protocol**
  - Stdio communication (primary)
  - Future support for SSE protocol
